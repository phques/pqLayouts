Chording
- added 'left-hand-prefixed right hand ordered chords'
  ex: lpsteaks main alt WR- PH-
  This lets you use a chord to enter two consecutive right hand keys from two layers.
  (the use-case is for a layout with consonants cluster in the right hand on two layers)
  The chord uses a left hand (textual) prefix, e.g. "WR-",
  followed by one or two keys on the right hand.
  There are two layers / two prefixes, so in the example:
  WR- indicates layer main->alt, so the 1st pressed right key is on main, 2nd is on alt
  PH- indicates layer alt->main
  If a single key is pressed on the right -> output the same key for each layer.

- bug fix: only start chording for valid chording keys DOWN
  (was getting stuck (lost shift up) shift)

Chording
- start new chording only for valid chording keys
- cancel chord if receive keyup for a key that was not in the chord
  (fixes the bugs about shift or layerAccess released before the shifted key)
- include 3keys chords for the 'must be pressed all together' test
  note: still a compromise, it can happen that a quick 'roll' is fast
  enough to be detected as a chord (specially woth 2keys roll)
