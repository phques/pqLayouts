Chording
- start new chording only for valid chording keys
- cancel chord if receive keyup for a key that was not in the chord
  (fixes the bugs about shift or layerAccess released before the shifted key)
- include 3keys chords for the 'must be pressed all together' test
  note: still a compromise, it can happen that a quick 'roll' is fast
  enough to be detected as a chord (specially woth 2keys roll)
