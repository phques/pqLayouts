Mods:
- angle mod + right hand vert swap, including GB, but keep Q; as is.
  this brings the G on top pinky, but let's try anyways :-p

- swap ., to make ',' easier than '.' (more important in code)
  note that I keep < > in same order as before though

- swap O U, as is done in hands-down
A E    A E
O U => U O

swap VF (lower freq V on top pinky)
swap /Z ("/?" in easier spot 'querty T')
