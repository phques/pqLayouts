Mods:
angle mod, 'full', V on left shift

Trying vert mirror of vowels, (keep GB in place, more common g on bottom)
make right hand bottom heavy, also now more similar to Hands-Down PM
(though they have B on bottm, but punct. on top)

swap ,. putting the more common ',' on a finger easier for me
(almost no diff in klanext analyzer)
note that to keep it easy, I'm keeping <> in the same original order .. 
so they are reversed vs ,. now but more logically placed
