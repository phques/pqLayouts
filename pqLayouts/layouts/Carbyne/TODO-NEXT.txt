So maybe I am better of using angle mode on NanCY 
Next stePS: 
 - create a keyboard help image for Carbyne-v0-PQangle-c
 - try Carbyne on Voyager! (with same vowels swap)
 
 - since PM uses AU EO, should I do that too!!?
   (to make it similar / whenever I go to HD I would be using the same vowel cluster)
