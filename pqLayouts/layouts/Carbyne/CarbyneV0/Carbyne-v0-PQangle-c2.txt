** does not seem to be able to remap Caps to Lsh !!?? (Win11 under VMWare on MacOS) ***
===> This is caused by Windows Sticky Keys !! seems I can't use both at the same time
  -=> ahhh, grrr it was working, now it doesn't work again, even with no sticky keys !!!!?!????

Trying vert mirror of vowels, v0 / old
make right hand bottom heavy, also now more similar to Hands-Down PM
trying to stay close to real layout to avoid confusion vs Voyager (no angle mod)

 b f h m z  q  o u y  w j 
 s n r t k  -  a e i  c x 
 v p l d /  ;  , ' .  g  

=>

 b f h m z  q  , ' .  w j 
 s n r t k  -  a e i  c x 
 v p l d /  ;  o u y  g
