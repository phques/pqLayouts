- Enthium, angle mod

- Using  right spacebar on my matias sculpt
  remapped to PRINTSCR to have a specific key to use for the layout
  So right SP => R

- W on ' is handled with:
  dualmod '  rshift w
  

- AngleMod brings a difficult choice:
 which of ' /  to put on the 'far off' B ?
 - / is much more common for programming than '
 - but vice versa for English
 => would need a way to swap them live!!
 ?=> or maybe swap x and ' :: bad lateral stretch e-x .. ?can handle by rotating handle down for alt fingering
