- Enthium, angle mod

- Using  right spacebar on my matias sculpt
  remapped to PRINTSCR to have a specific key to use for the layout
  So right SP => R

- W on ' is handled with:
  dualmod '  rshift w
  

- AngleMod will keep , . on same fingers as on ergo:
  Original Enthium:  
  c i a e -
  ' , . ; /
  
  Considering that ; : have their own combo,
  once angled:
  c i a e -
   , . ' / ;

note: with order for " vs /  (e" e/ are both SFB on index!)
 we can "rake"  e" which is a SFB, as suggested by WEB Page for Enthium for some of the SFBs
 and moving / to the right, it is still easy access
