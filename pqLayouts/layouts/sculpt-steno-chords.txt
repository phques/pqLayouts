
Punctuation / syms steno (PLover) strokes, (that work on my Sculpt!)

for use on ANSI restricted nbr keys layout
and/or on a possible Georig (steno kbd) hybrid steno/normal layout

  ,.-"_')(;=:/*!?$>{}[]\+|&<%@#^`~
 
 
nb: short (2keys) ones might be triggered by accident on rolls !! 
.. might need to try out based on layout.
.. when across the two hands, probably ok anyways

nb: "ol" qwerty does not work (PB)

oh, and pqLayouts can only send ONE output key,
ie no space after ,  etc
(and does not do chords yet haha!)

?? Use NM for right hand thumbs in wide?
   Techn. would be M,  but might be uncomfy / tough
 BUT using M, lets me do OEU for '/', cf / below


in wide mode, qwerty :

! we need a real backspace, with auto repeat !


'.' no space (these might be too short anyways!?)
 e-o		(p-p)
 e-[		(p-t)

'.' with space after (??)
(that's the one I am used to .. use this one w. no space?)
