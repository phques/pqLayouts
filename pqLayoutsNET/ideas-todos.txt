-> keynames (for modifiers & other keys)
-> modifiers prefixes on (out) keys ("+r", "^c", "!tab")
->? user defined keys, then used in mappings, access with "@macroName"
   (to avoid needing to support all special keys directly in mappings?)

-> "action" / special keys
  - mod / tap
    (this what is used in QMK for HRMs?)
	#define TAPPING_TERM 200
  - access layer
  - toggle layer
  - switch to layer
  - output string
  - output string, "smart shift" (for eg combo nt='th', shift-nt='Th'
  - caps word
    - similar to QMK (space ends mode, '-' => '_')
    - camel case (space for 'word begin', start lower to permit "someCamelCase"?)	

- combos
- adaptives
  - reader figures out \b to output
    compare input to output, starting at 1st char, to know how much we need to back up
- layers (edit layer!)
  + access
    - normal (modifier mode, like shift)
    - layer / tap
	  - to do layer/toggle, use tap= action "toggle layer"
	  
- ? tap dance / "multi taps"
  - needs "timeout" /
