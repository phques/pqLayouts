+ with the keyboard low level hook and SendInput, we are working with KEYS (virtual keys, ie VK_xx),
  not characters .. ie if we want to map (unshifted) key 'q' to '?',
  we need to send shift-/ (?)

+ the VK_ values for a..z are A..Z, uppercase !
 -> using VkKeyScanExA() seems to handle this correctly

 -> NOTE, this also means doing a French layout is not easily possible !!
  (again we don't output characters, but keys ..)
   -> it would need to find the VK_xx code(s) from a french MS layout,
   when we use our mappings, we need to have the correct MS layout active too

   -> chars like 'à' that I type with a deakey + a, how to generate this ??
      SendInput both ??
      -> possibly use the US intl layout, it might have all required accented chars on altGr?
         not really, needs dead keys
	   -> use azerty ?
	   -> build my own !!?

   -> it seems like VkKeyScanExA w/o a kbdLayout parameter looks in all installed MS layouts !
     -> for eg passing é while in a US layout, will correctly find / (which output é in CAFR layout)

   -> not very clear behaviour .. if the CAFR layout is active VkKeyScanExA seems to actually fail !???
      also à does not map correctly ? (kinda expected)
      will need to try loading a kbd layout and pass it to VkKeyScanExA

   -> probably works if we load and pass a KHL for french layout to VkKeyScanExA
     (now using VkKeyScanA)

 
+ -- scancode vs VK ----

// with Windows layouts that use AltGr, right Alt actually outputs
// LCtrl + RAlt .. but with a weird scancode for LCtrl, (0x21D instead of 0x1D)
// ie we don't send exactly the same vk / scancode, it screws up and LCtrl up is never generated !!!

@A20D0B   wparam: 104 vk: A2 scan: 21D  dn  ex flags: 00100000
@A20D0B   wparam: 104 vk: A5 scan: 38  dn  EX flags: 00100001

+ Note also that apparently, contrary to what I would expect, 
  a scancode does NOT identify a physical key, (I thought that was the definition of a scancode !!!)
  -> both left and right Ctrl have the same scancode (right ones are flagged 'extended' though)
  -> BUT they DO have different VKs !
  -> also see nte above for AltGr's LCtrl

+ getting the scancode from the VK does not seem to be 100% possible !
UINT scancode = MapVirtualKeyExA(vk, MAPVK_VK_TO_VSC_EX, NULL);
// a few keys don't seem to properly convert to scan code (kbd specific?)
//## PrtScrn, Pause don't convert to the scancode that we received in the kbd hook event !?

-----------

+? should map keys based on both (VK & scancode), to avoid probs for eg w. AltGr,
  see above
 => how to be certain I have the correct scancodes ??
    -> need to learn the kbd ?? pretty annoying
    -> I guess that mapping on vk_scan and ignoring unknown values should be Ok

+ chording
---
- support pre-mapping .. ie, A -> S  T,G,U,J -> *
- use real steno keys to define chords
- use a single command to define multiple chords,
  w. begin/end token (vs using 'kord' on each)

+ #include files
  - for edit, numpad, chords..

+ one-shot modifier, layer
  (set temp 'need xyz' flag in found action key?)

+ to reduce the chances of accidental chording of two keys chords (R-R = enter),
  add a time constraint on those: they must be chorded inside a short time.
